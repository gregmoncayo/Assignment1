3D. ) Two reasons why branches are used in a Git Repository are because people work on different things, sometimes the same thing, at the same time. In this situation branches are used to push your work to the main tree that stores the entire project, that way people working at two different or same things at the same time won't affect their work. Another reason why people use branches is it can be used to not mess with the original body of code. You could add another branch that will link to another set where you could include a test code, beta, new feature, and many more. This allows programmers to work on new features without messing with the original code that may be out for the public/private use.

3E. ) Git status shows the working tree status while git log shows commit logs.

3F. ) git log --committer "author name" or git show "Weapon.h"

3G. ) Inerhitance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types. Encapsulation is used to refer to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination thereof: A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
